<p>Bash is the most common shell on Linux, and I have been using it since my
early days of learning Linux, but when I get into the world of BSD system,
things are changed. The default shell is ash for FreeBSD, and ksh for
OpenBSD. Although they all belong to Bourne family (shown as the below picture),
their syntax differs a lot. That means many of my Bash scripts that utilize
features specific to Bash are not compatible to BSD system if I want to insist
on BSD's default shell.</p>

<p>If I only talk about the portability of the shell language itself, it still can
be achievable by following the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface)
shell specifications, as most Bourne-family shells are compatible with POSIX.
Even though the POSIX shell has some limitations, it is still featured enough,
and syntatic sugar in Bash can be rewritten in the POSIX style.</p>
<p>For example, in Bash, for condition expressions quoted by <span class="docutils literal">[[</span>, there is no
need to use doube quotation for variables whose value include whitespaces.
That can be implemented in the POSIX shell, using <span class="docutils literal">[</span> and quoting any
variables including whitespaces:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">$ v=&quot;a b&quot;

# in Bash
$ [[ $v = &quot;a b&quot; ]]

# in POSIX
$ [ &quot;$v&quot; = &quot;a b&quot; ]</pre>
<p>Another example is the rediction symbol <span class="docutils literal">|&amp;</span> in Bash, which pipes both
standard output and standard error, is just a shorthand for <span class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2&gt;&amp;1</span> |</span>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block"># in Bash
$ MOZ_LOG=&quot;PlatformDecoderModule:5&quot; firefox |&amp; grep VA-VAPI

# in POSIX
$ MOZ_LOG=&quot;PlatformDecoderModule:5&quot; firefox 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep VA-API&quot;</pre>
<p>However, portable shell scripts do not only mean using the shell language
compatible over different shell varieties, but also involve the portability of
programs external to the shell. Most shell scripts need to use a number of
programs other than the shell itself to achieve their ends. Compared to the
divergence in the functions and options offered by programs, the variance
of all the shell languages is relatively trivial.</p>
