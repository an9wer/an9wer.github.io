There are two types of keyboard values in Xorg: keycodes and keysyms.

-   `keycode`: The keycode is the numeric representation (which may be
    specified in decimal, hex or octal and can be determined by running the
    `xev` program) received by the kernel when a key or a mouse button is
    pressed.
    
-   `keysym`: The keysym is the value assigned to the keycode. For example,
    pressing 'a' generates the keycode 38, which is mapped to the keysym 0x61,
    which matches a in the ASCII table. The keysyms are managed by Xorg in a
    table of keycodes defining the keycode-keysym relations, which is called
    the keymap table. This can be shown by running xmodmap.

== Options ==

-   `-e expression`: This option specifies an expression to be executed. Any
    number of expressions may be specified from the command line.

-   `-pm`: This option indicates that the current modifier map should be
    printed on the standard output. This is the default mode of operation if no
    other mode options are specified.

-   `-pke`: This option indicates that the current keymap table should be
    printed on the standard output in the form of  expres‐ sions that can be
    fed back to xmodmap.

== Expressions ==

There are two vital expressions which have the same effect, they all assign the
list of keysyms to the indicated keycode:

{{{
    keycode NUMBER = KEYSYMNAME ...
}}}

{{{
    keysym KEYSYMNAME = KEYSYMNAME ...
}}}

*Note*: In the second expression, The KEYSYMNAME on the left hand side is
translated into matching keycodes used to perform the corresponding  set  of
keycode  expressions. 

*Note*: In all expressions, Keysyms on the left hand side of the = sign are
looked up before any changes are made. This makes it possible to swap modifier
keys.
