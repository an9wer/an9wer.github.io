Bash Quoting
============


Double quote
    Enclosing characters in double quotes preserves the literal value of all
    characters within the quotes,  with the exception  of **$**, **`**, **\\**,
    and when history expansion is enabled, **!**.

Single quote
    Enclosing characters in single quotes preserves the literal value of each
    character within the quotes. **A single quote may not occur between single
    quotes, even when preceded by a backslash.**
