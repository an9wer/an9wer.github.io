About Me
========

Hi there, I am an9wer - right, it is a nickname, becuase I perfer to not use my
real name on the internet. My area of interest is \*nix operation system (more
recently, Gentoo and FreeBSD), including customizing CLI and GUI tools, and
diving into the system.


By the way, this website is built with docutils_, and hosted on `Github Pages`_.
