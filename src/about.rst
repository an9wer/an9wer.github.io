About Me
========

Hi there, I am an9wer - right, it is a nickname, becuase I perfer to not use my
real name on the internet. My area of interest is \*nix operation system (more
recently, Gentoo and OpenBSD), including customizing CLI and GUI tools, and
diving into the system.

should be noticed.

**2023-09-28*** adding the "about" page - say hello and talk a bit about me.
