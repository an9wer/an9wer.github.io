Baseboard management contruller (BCM):

Embedded device or service. Typically an independent microprocessor or
system-on-chip with associated firmware in a computer system that completes
out-of-band systems monitoring and management-related task.

Out of band management (OOBM):

By contrast, in-band management through VNC, SSH or even serial ports is based
on in-band connectivity and software that must be installed on the remote
system being managed and only works after the operating system has been booted.

Parallel vs serial

-   `Why Is Serial Data Transmission Faster Than Parallel Data Transmission?
    <https://www.howtogeek.com/171947/why-is-serial-data-transmission-faster-than-parallel-data-transmission/>`_

    You cannot increase the signal frequency for a parallel transmission
    without limit, because, by design, all signals from the transmitter need to
    arrive at the receiver at the same time. 

-   `The Difference Between Parallel & Serial Communication <https://www.techwalla.com/articles/the-difference-between-parallel-serial-communication>`_

    The use of fewer wires in serial communication makes its signals clearer,
    thus making it suitable for long distance communication.

**Q**: If a motherboard/cpu doesn't explicitly support a RAM frequency, is still
compatible?

**A**: If you buy a memory card whose speed faster than what your
motherboard/cpu support, it will adjust the speeds down automatically to fit
motherboard/cpu.
