File searching
--------------

See *:h file-searching*

The file searching is currently used for the *path*, *cdpath* and *tags*
options, for `finddir()` and `findfile()`.  Other commands use `wildcards`
which is slightly different.

There are three different types of searching:

1.  Downward searching ('**', '*')
2.  Upward searching (';')
3.  Combined up/donwward searching ('**', '*', ';')
