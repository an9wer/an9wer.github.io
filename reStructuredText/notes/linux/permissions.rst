    A subject with a certain access permission is capable of passing that
    permission (perhaps indirectly) on to any other subject.

    With mandatory access control, this security policy is centrally controlled
    by a security policy administrator; users do not have the ability to
    override the policy and, for example, grant access to files that would
    otherwise be restricted. By contrast, discretionary access control (DAC),
    which also governs the ability of subjects to access objects, allows users
    the ability to make policy decisions and/or assign security attributes.
